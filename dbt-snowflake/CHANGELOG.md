## Unreleased

### Features
- Support optional account and user fields in profiles.yml for default authenticator without password. When using the default authenticator (no `authenticator` field specified) without a password, `account` and `user` fields are now optional, allowing for authentication via environment variables or other external mechanisms. This provides more flexible configuration options while maintaining security requirements for other authentication methods.
